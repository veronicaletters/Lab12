           <h1>The Christmas Song</h1>
            <p>
                Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <br>
                Jack Frost nipping at your nose <br>
                Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <br>
                And folks dressed up like Eskimos <br>
                Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <br>
                Help to make the season bright <br>
                Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <br>
                Will find it hard to sleep tonight <br>
                They know that Santa's on his way <br>
                He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <br>
            </p>
            <p>     
                And every mother's child is gonna spy <br>
                To see if reindeers really know how to fly <br>
                And so I'm offering this simple phrase <br>
                To kids from one to ninety-two <br>
                Although it's been said many times, many ways <br>
                Merry Christmas to you <br>
                And so I'm offering this simple phrase <br>
