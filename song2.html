           <h1>Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!</h1>
            <p>
                Oh, the weather outside is frightful <br>
                But the fire is so delightful<br>
                And since we've no place to go<br>
                Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!<br>
                Man it doesn't show signs of stopping<br>
                And I brought me some corn for popping<br>
                The lights are turned way down low<br>
                Let it snow! Let it snow!<br>
                When we finally kiss goodnight<br>
                How I'll hate going out in the storm<br>
                But if you'll really hold me tight<br>
                All the way home I'll be warm<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                And the fire is slowly dying<br>
                And, my dear, we're still goodbying<br>
                But as long as you'd love me so<br>
                Let it snow! Let it snow and snow!<br>
                When we finally kiss goodnight<br>
                How I'll hate going out in the storm<br>
                But if you really grab me tight<br>
                All the way home I'll be warm<br>
                Oh, the fire is slowly dying<br>
                And, my dear, we're still goodbying<br>
                But as long as you'd love me so<br>
                Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!<br>
